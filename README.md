# Image_compression-DCT

Technolgy used :

python 3 and opencv

Steps:

1: Apply DCT and perform quantization
2: Zigzag scanning
3: Image Encoding and write bitstream to a file(Image.txt)
4: Read image.txt then perform Image Decoding 
5: constructing intensity matrix form frequency matrix
6: Generate comressed using inverse_zigzag image after decoding
